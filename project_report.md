# Project Report - IT110 Project 1 
## File Review and Organization Plan
**Author:** Bertnah Nerjuste
**Date:** November 2025 

## 1. Introduction 
The purpose of this project was review the content of a ZIP archive containing student ubmissions with inconsistent and unclear file names. The objectives was to examine the files, document findings, and create findings, and create a proposed solution for organizing them in a clean and scalable structure. 

## 2. Observations 
- Many filenames consisted of long, random, hash-like strings.
- No directory strcuture was preset.
- Files contind identifiable student information.
- Data for different courses and assignments was mixed together.
- No naming conventions existed.

  ## 3. Tools & Commands Used
  I evaluated the files using various Linux commands:

- `ls` - list filenames
- `head` - preview file contents 
- `cd` - navigate directories
- `scp` - transfer files to remote server
- `mkdir` - example of making new directories
- `mv` - example of how files would be reorganized

## 4. Propsed Directory Structure
The following structure organizes files by 

- Course
- Assignment/Project
- Student Name

### IT110/Python_Assignment4.py/JohnDoe_Python_Assignment4.py

## 5. Proposed Naming Conventions 
A consistent naming system:

`LastName_FirstName_Project#.txt`

This improves readability, searchability, and scalability. 

## 6. Conclusion 
Although the files were not reorganized directly, this project demonstrates the ability to analyze unstructured data, plan an organizational structure, and document technical processes-all valuable skills in IT and System administration.
