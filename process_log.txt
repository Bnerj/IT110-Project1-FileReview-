## Project Overview
This project involved analyzing a ZIP archive containing numerous disorganized student files with inconsistent naming, hash-like filenames, and no clear directory structure. The objective was not to reorganize the file directly, but to:    

- Review and assess the contents of the ZIP archive 
- Document each step taken using Linux command-line tools 
- Identify issues with the existing file organization 
- Propose a complete, logical solution for restructuring the data
- Answer reflection and analysis questions in a written report

This repository includes the process log and final report summarizing findings and proposed solution 

# What I Did in This Project

- Used Linux commands (`ls`, `head`, `mkdir`, `mv`)
- Transferred the ZIP archive to a remote server using `scp`
- Navigated and examined files in a UNIX environment 
- Created a detailed, step-by-step activity log 
- Proposed a directory hierarchy based on course/assignment/student information
- Suggested standard file-naming conventions to replace hash-like filenames 
- Wrote a complete technical analysis and report 

# Repository Contents 

- process_log.txt - Timestamped log of actions performed 
- project_report.md - Full write-up, findings, and proposed solution

**Note** - No original student data is included to protect privacy 

# Skills Demonstrated 
- **Linux Command-Line Proficiency** 
Navigating directories, viewing file contents, creating folders, planning file moves


- **Remote Server Interaction**
Transferring files using `scp`, working on a remote Ubuntu environment 


- **File System Analysis**
Reviewing disorganized files and designing a scalable organizational strategy


- **Technical Documentation**
Writing clear logs, messy data, and designing logical, repeatable workflow


- **Problem-Solving & Structured Thinking**
Taking unclear, messy data, and designing a logical, repeatable workflow 


- **Version Control & GitHub Usage**
Uploading reports/logs and maintaining a professional technical repository 

# Summary 

This project demonstrates my ability to work in a Linux environment, analyze unstructured data, document processes, and propose technical solutions - all essential skills for entry-level IT, Support, Cybersecurity, and System Administration roles.

```bash 
ls
```

2025-09-10 6:56 PM  
- Viewed sample file contents to determine structure  
```bash 
head filename.txt
```

2025-09-10 7:01 PM
