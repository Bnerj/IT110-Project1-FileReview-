# Project Overview
This project involved analzing a ZIP archive containing numerous disorganized student files with inconsistent naming, hash-like filenames, and no clear directory structure. The objective was not to reorganize the file directly, but to:    

- Review and asses the contents of the ZIP archive 
- Document each step tken usng Linux command-line tools 
- Identify issues with the existing file organization 
- Propose a complete, logical solution for restructuring the data
- Answer reflectio and analysis questions in a written report

This repository includes the process log and final report summarizing findings and proposed solution.

# What I Did in This Project

- Used Linux commands ('ls', 'head', 'mkdir'. 'mv')
- Transferred the ZIP archive to a remote server using 'scp'
- Navigated and examined files in a UNIX environment 
- Created a detailed step-by-step activity log 
- Proposed a directory hierarchy based on course - assignment - student information
- Suggested standard file-naming conventions to replace hash-like filenames 
- Wrote a complete technical analysis and report.
